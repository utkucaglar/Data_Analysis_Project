# Data Analysis Project

## Project Motivation
By investigating this dataset, I aim to uncover patterns and relationships, particularly focusing on how external factors, such as exams or homework, influence physical activity levels. Visualizing these findings will help construct and support well-founded claims about the data. Additionally, I will compare data from my smartwatch and phone app to evaluate their reliability and explore potential discrepancies as a secondary motivation.

## Research Questions
1. **Activity Patterns**:
   - How do physical activity levels vary during periods of high academic stress, such as exams or homework-heavy weeks?
   - Are there observable differences in activity between weekdays and weekends?

2. **External Influences**:
   - What role do factors such as weather or travel days play in shaping physical activity trends?

3. **Device Comparison**:
   - How consistent are the measurements between my smartwatch and phone app for steps, kilometers, and flights climbed, calories burned?
   - Do discrepancies exist between the datasets, and what might explain them?

4. **Long-Term Trends**:
   - What general trends emerge from daily, weekly, and monthly activity data?

## Dataset Description
- **Smartwatch Data**: Includes daily records of steps taken, kilometers traveled, flights climbed, and calorie burn.
- **Phone App Data**: Similar activity metrics captured using GPS and motion sensors.
- Additional data, such as weather conditions or personal stress logs, may be incorporated to add context.

## Project Aims
1. **Identify Patterns**: Explore how physical activity changes during academic stress periods and other external influences.
2. **Validate Data Sources**: Compare data from the smartwatch and phone app to assess accuracy and reliability.
3. **Visualize Findings**: Create visualizations that clearly illustrate activity trends, relationships, and discrepancies between datasets.
4. **Draw Insights and Recommendations**: Use findings to evaluate the effectiveness of wearable devices and their tracking methods.

## Example Claims
1. **Activity Impact of Exams**: Physical activity decreases significantly during exam weeks compared to normal routines, reflecting the influence of academic stress.
2. **Device Discrepancies**: Initial comparisons suggest inconsistencies between smartwatch and phone app data, particularly in step counts.

## Project Plan
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gather and prepare data from both sources for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Investigate trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
3. **Comparison Analysis**: Evaluate discrepancies between smartwatch and phone app metrics.
4. **Visualization**: Develop graphs and charts to support claims and highlight findings.
5. **Report**: Compile insights, conclusions, and recommendations into a cohesive report.
