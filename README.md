# Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project explores personal physical activity data collected from two sources: my smartwatch and a companion phone app. The primary goal is to analyze and visualize daily activity metrics, including:
- Steps taken
- Kilometers traveled
- Flights climbed

By investigating this dataset, I aim to uncover patterns and relationships, particularly focusing on how external factors, such as exams or homework, influence physical activity levels. Visualizing these findings will help construct and support well-founded claims.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of:
- **Smartwatch Data**: Daily activity records including steps, distance, and floors climbed.
- **Phone App Data**: Additional records that complement the smartwatch data, providing a more holistic view of physical activity.

Additional data may be incorporated if relevant connections are identified during the analysis.

## Project Plan
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Organize and preprocess the smartwatch and phone data for consistency and accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identify trends and relationships within the dataset.
3. **Visualization**: Create visual representations (e.g., graphs, charts) to highlight key findings.
4. **Claim Construction**: Develop evidence-based claims, such as changes in activity levels during exams or homework-heavy periods.
5. **Report and Presentation**: Compile the analysis and visualizations into a clear and cohesive report.

## Example Claim
One hypothesis I plan to explore is the fluctuation in physical activity levels during weeks with exams or intensive homework. This analysis will reveal how academic responsibilities impact physical activity and will guide the development of additional claims as I further explore the dataset.
